This is coding challenge 14!


Important!

In this project, the display functionality for the customer support tickets was implemented alongside the data fetching process in Commit 2. Therefore, there was no need for a separate commit for displaying tickets in Commit 3, as the necessary code to dynamically append the tickets to the HTML list was already included in the previous commit. This streamlined approach reduces the number of commits while maintaining clarity and cohesion in the codebase. Each commit focuses on essential features, enhancing the overall efficiency of the development process without compromising the project's functionality.
